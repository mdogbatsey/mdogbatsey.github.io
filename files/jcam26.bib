abstract = {Solving the nonlinear and degenerate p-Laplace equation numerically is highly challenging, yet it has numerous applications across various fields. In this work, we propose and explore numerical schemes, including Picard’s Iteration scheme, Crank-Nicolson (CN) method, and Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) scheme, for solving the p-Laplace equation in R3 for p ∈ [1, 2), aiming to identify the most effective numerical approaches within the framework of finite difference methods. In the existing literature, studies on the parabolic p-Laplace equation primarily consider the Cauchy problem with p ≥ 2. Our study bridges this gap by examining the parabolic p-Laplace equation for p ∈ [1, 2). To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on the three-dimensional (3D) case. Our results demonstrate that the ADI scheme is the most efficient among the proposed 3D numerical schemes as it requires the least computational time while maintaining comparable accuracy in both analytical tests and solvation energy calculations. Moreover, we numerically verify that the solution of the pseudo-time parabolic p-Laplace equation converges to the solution of the corresponding highly nonlinear elliptic p-Laplace equation.}
